<h1> Welcome to my blog</h1>


<p> Hi my name is Susan, I reside in Sydney, Australia. My background was in the medical field however after graduating and working within it for 4 years I decided it was not for me.</p>
<p>So I decided to look at what other options were out there and hence have ended up here, where I'll be documenting my journey into becoming a web developer.</p>

<p>Here is a picture of a kitten because I love them.</p>

Make a list of three important things to know about you

Include a favorite quote, with citation for the person who said it

If you still need more to do, make a page about some of your hobbies and activities. Include:

What is this hobby exactly?

How does it make you feel?

Where have you traveled because of your hobby? What other life experiences has your hobby provided, that you might not otherwise experience?

If you manage to get as far as creating both web pages, link them together with a navigation bar.
